# Privacy Policy – ShortlistSignal.com  
Last updated: 9 December 2025

We keep this simple because we hate long privacy policies too.

What we collect  
- Your name, email, (optional) phone, nearest city  
- The company, role, date, and stage of interviews you reached  
- Screenshots / files you upload as proof  
- IP address and basic analytics when you visit the site

What we do with it  
- We look at your uploaded proof (automated + occasional manual review) to decide if we show a “Proof uploaded” or “Employer confirmed” flag.  
- We may email the interviewer/HR contact (with your explicit consent) to confirm the interview happened.  
- We show your name, role history, flags, and city to logged-in recruiters who pay us.  
- We never sell your data to third-party advertisers.

How long we keep it  
- Proof files are automatically deleted 12 months after upload (or sooner if you ask).  
- Profile data is kept until you delete your account or we shut the service down.

Your rights (GDPR & UK GDPR)  
You can email hello@shortlistsignal.com at any time to:  
- See all data we hold on you  
- Correct anything wrong  
- Delete everything (right to be forgotten)  
We’ll action it within 30 days (usually same day).

Security  
Data is stored encrypted in the EU/UK. Only the founder has access.

Questions  
Email contact@shortlistsignal.com – I (the founder) personally read every message.
