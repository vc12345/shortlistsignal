# Terms of Service – ShortlistSignal.com  
Last updated: 9 December 2025

1. The service is 100 % free for candidates forever.
2. You promise the information and proof you upload is true and belongs to you.
3. We can remove or hide any profile if we believe it’s fake or breaks these rules.
4. We are not responsible if a recruiter contacts you and it goes badly — you control who sees your data.
5. We can change or shut down the service at any time (we’ll email you first).
6. English law applies. If we ever argue, we’ll try to sort it out over email before anything formal.

That’s literally it.
